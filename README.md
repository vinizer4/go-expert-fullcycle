## Go Expert Postgraduate Fullcycle Program Repository

This repository documents my learning journey throughout the [GoExpert Postgraduate Fullcycle Program](https://goexpert.fullcycle.com.br/pos-goexpert), focusing on achieving mastery in Go programming.

### Program Focus

This program provides a deep dive into Go, covering fundamental and advanced topics to build high-performance, scalable, and maintainable applications. The curriculum emphasizes:

* **Strong Foundations:** Understanding Go's core principles, syntax, data structures, and control flow.
* **Automated Testing:** Implementing robust testing strategies using Go's built-in testing framework to ensure code quality.
* **API Development:** Building efficient and scalable APIs with Go, exploring routing, handling requests, and best practices.
* **Performance Optimization & Concurrency:** Mastering Go's concurrency model, leveraging goroutines and channels for high-performance applications.
* **Clean Architecture:** Applying design principles and best practices to create maintainable and scalable Go projects.
* **Go Internals:** Delving into Go's runtime, garbage collection, memory management, and other internal mechanisms for deeper understanding and optimization.

### Repository Structure

This repository is organized by modules, reflecting the program structure. Each module will include:

* **Code:**  Practical examples, exercises, and projects developed throughout the module.
* **Notes:** My personal notes, explanations of key concepts, and reflections on the learning material.
* **Research:** Links to articles, documentation, and resources that enhance my understanding of the topics covered.

### Learning Objectives

My key goals for this postgraduate program are:
